# Java games
Games developed using Java programming language
This class project focuses on the "jeu du canon," a game where the goal is to aim and fire a cannon to hit a target at a certain distance. The project was developed step by step, with a progressive approach to building the game's various features. It utilizes specific libraries that were chosen to simplify the management of graphics, trajectory calculations, and the simulation of the shot. These libraries helped structure the project efficiently and ensure a smooth and realistic experience for the user.
